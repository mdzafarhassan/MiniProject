# Project Title

This is my First Project on Django(Python).

I hope i will learn new things while making/completing this and eventually make this project better.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on
your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment
for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

- Python (recomened python3.8+)
- django (recomened django2.2+)
- Code Editior of choice (recomened VS Code or PyCharm)

Please reffer their respective documentaions on how to install/setup and configure on local machine.

### Installing

If you have prior experince on how to clone code from git and setup on local machine then feel free to follow your own steps.

In case you need in cloning and setting up on local machine, just follow these following steps.

#### Step 1: Creating Virtual Environment

Make sure you system have _virtualenv_ installed for this step, if not use following command to install _virtualenv_

```
sudo apt upgrade
sudo pip3 install virtualenv
```

Now, create a virtual environment by following command at your desired location.

```
python3 -m venv venv
```

Now activate the created virtual environment by `source ./venv/bin/activate` command

#### Step 2: Clone code form git

Make sure you system have _git_ installed for this step, if not use

```
sudo apt upgrade
apt-get install git-core

```

Now, run the below command to clone code from git to your local machine at your desired location.

```
git clone https://github.com/mdzafarhassan/MiniProject.git

```

NOTE : If you don't wish to use git for getting copy of code you can also download project zip file directly by [clicking Here](https://github.com/mdzafarhassan/MiniProject/archive/master.zip) and skip this step, But doing will also means you won't be able perform action related/provided by git, like pull, diff, stash etc.

#### Step 3: Installing packages for dependencies

Once code cloning is complete, you will find a file _requriment.txt_ file in code base file. This file contaions list of all the external packages required by this project.

you can install all of them once (recursively) by `pip install -r requirement.txt` command (make sure virtual environment is active).
